# DIA-Star-Analysis
Python Project where the goal is to analyse data on starcraft 2 replays
link to the dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SkillCraft1+Master+Table+Dataset

1. A PowerPoint explaining the ins and outs of the problem, your thoughts on the asked
question, the different variables you created, how the problem fits in the context of the
study, etc: 25%.
2. A code in python:
a) Data pre-processing: encoding, normalization, imputation… 15%.
b) Data visualization (use matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh ...): show the link between
the variables and the target: 15%.
c) Modeling: use the scikit-learn library to try several algorithms, change the
hyper parameters, do a grid search, compare the results of your models using
graphics: 30%
3. Transformation of the model into an API of your choice (Django or flask): 15%.
An email + a GitHub + the filling of a google drive sheet are expected:
1. Put your work on your GitHub account:
a) A readme summarizing the task to be accomplished and your conclusions.
b) The pdf version of your PowerPoint.
c) The code in Jupyter notebook format.
d) The Django or Flask API.
2. Put the link to your GitHub on the following page:
