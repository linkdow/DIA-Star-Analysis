# DIA-Star-Analysis

Subject: "ESILV - Python for data analysis - project 2023".

Python Project where the goal is to analyse data on starcraft 2 replays
link to the dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SkillCraft1+Master+Table+Dataset

We tried to predict a 'new' player rank in StarCraft. 

This github contains : 
1. A PowerPoint explaining the ins and outs of the problem, your thoughts on the asked
question, the different variables you created, how the problem fits in the context of the
study, etc.
2. A code in python (jupyter notebook):
a) Data pre-processing: encoding, normalization, imputationâ€¦ 
b) Data visualization (use matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh ...): show the link between
the variables and the target.
c) Modeling: use the scikit-learn library to try several algorithms, change the
hyper parameters, do a grid search, compare the results of your models using
graphics.
3. Transformation of the model into an API : streamlit (file : stlite.py + model_lassoCV.vas which contain our saved model)
